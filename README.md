## Features

- Add a new book with title, author, genre, and ISBN.
- Edit existing book details.
- Delete a book by its ISBN.
- Search for books by title, author, or genre.

## Dependencies

- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): Web application framework for Node.js.
- [Knex.js](http://knexjs.org/): SQL query builder for Node.js.
- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/): Open-source relational database management system.

## Project Setup

### Setting Up the Project

1. Create a new Node.js project.
2. Install necessary dependencies using the following command:

    ```bash
    npm install express knex mysql
    ```

### Database Setup

1. Set up a MySQL database for the library.
2. Define a schema for the `books` table.

### Knex Configuration

1. Configure Knex.js to connect to your MySQL database. See [Knex Configuration](http://knexjs.org/#Installation-client) for details.

### Creating API Endpoints

1. Create routes for the following endpoints:
    - `GET /books` - Retrieve a list of all books.
    - `GET /books/:isbn` - Retrieve a specific book by its ISBN.
    - `POST /books` - Add a new book.
    - `PUT /books/:isbn` - Edit the details of a book.
    - `DELETE /books/:isbn` - Delete a book by its ISBN.

### Implementing Controllers

1. Create controller functions to handle the logic for each route.

### Error Handling

1. Implement error handling for cases like invalid requests or database errors.

### Testing

1. Use a tool like Postman or a testing library like Mocha and Chai to test your API endpoints.

### Validation

1. Implement input validation to ensure that the data being sent is correct.

### Documentation

1. Create a basic API documentation explaining how to use the endpoints.

### Security

1. Consider adding features like authentication and authorization if needed.

Remember to handle edge cases, validations, and security concerns in your project. Additionally, you can further extend this project by adding features like user authentication, user roles, and more advanced search capabilities.
